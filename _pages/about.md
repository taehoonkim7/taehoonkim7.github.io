Welcome! I am **Taehoon Kim**, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher under [*Dr. Kevin Begcy*](https://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/begcy-lab/).

I was born and raised in South Korea, where I completed my Master's at Seoul National University under *Dr. Nam-Chon Paek*, investigating the regulatory role of transcription factors in leaf senescence and abiotic stress responses in rice. Seeking new challenges, I then moved to the United States to pursue my Ph.D. at the University of Florida, studying molecular and epigenomic dynamics during rice female gametophyte development under *Dr. Begcy*–a journey I recently completed.

Currently, as a postdoc, I’m exploring the molecular mechanism of de novo DNA methylation in rice female gametophyte development. By integrating bioinformatic approaches for genome-scale insights and molecular biology techniques, I aim to understand the epigenetic regulation critical to plant reproductive success.

Beyond academia, I enjoy listening to music and playing the bass guitar, both of which often inspire a fresh perspective in my scholarly work. If you’d like to learn more about my research or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
