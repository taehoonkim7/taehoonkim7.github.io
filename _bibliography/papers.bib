	abstract = {The onset of leaf senescence is triggered by external cues and internal factors such as phytohormones and signaling pathways involving transcription factors (TFs). Abscisic acid (ABA) strongly induces senescence and endogenous ABA levels are finely tuned by many senescence-associated TFs. Here, we report on the regulatory function of the senescence-induced TF OsWRKY5 TF in rice (Oryza sativa). OsWRKY5 expression was rapidly upregulated in senescing leaves, especially in yellowing sectors initiated by aging or dark treatment. A T-DNA insertion activation-tagged OsWRKY5-overexpressing mutant (termed oswrky5-D) promoted leaf senescence under natural and dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions. By contrast, a T-DNA insertion oswrky5-knockdown mutant (termed oswrky5) retained leaf greenness during DIS. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that OsWRKY5 upregulates the expression of genes controlling chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2. Precocious leaf yellowing in the oswrky5-D mutant might be caused by elevated endogenous ABA concentrations resulting from upregulated expression of ABA biosynthesis genes OsNCED3, OsNCED4, and OsNCED5, indicating that OsWRKY is a positive regulator of ABA biosynthesis during leaf senescence. Furthermore, OsWRKY5 expression was suppressed by ABA treatment. Taken together, OsWRKY5 is a positive regulator of leaf senescence that upregulates senescence-induced NAC, ABA biosynthesis, and chlorophyll degradation genes.},

	abstract = {Heat shock factors (Hsfs) and Heat shock proteins (Hsps) belong to an essential group of molecular regulators involved in controlling cellular processes under normal and stress conditions. The role of Hsfs and Hsps is well known in model plant species under diverse stress conditions. While plants Hsfs are vital components of the signal transduction response to maintain cellular homeostasis, Hsps function as chaperones helping to maintain folding of damaged and newly formed proteins during stress conditions. In lettuce (Lactuca sativa), a highly consumed vegetable crop grown in the field and in hydroponic systems, the role of these gene families in response to artificial light is not well characterized. Using a genome-wide analysis approach, we identified 32 Hsfs and 22 small heat shock proteins (LsHsps) in lettuce, some of which do not have orthologs in Arabidopsis, poplar, and rice. LsHsp60s, LsHsp90s, and LsHsp100s are highly conserved among dicot and monocot species. Surprisingly, LsHsp70s have three times more members than Arabidopsis and two times more than rice. Interestingly, the lettuce genome triplication did not contribute to the increased number of LsHsp70s genes. The large number of LsHsp70s was the result of genome tandem duplication. Chromosomal distribution analysis shows larger tandem repeats of LsHsp70s genes in Chr1, Chr7, Chr8, and Chr9. At the transcriptional level, some genes of the LsHsfs, LsHsps, LsHsp60s, and LsHsp70s families were highly responsive to UV and high intensity light stress, in contrast to LsHsp90s and LsHsp100s which did not respond to a light stimulus. Our genome-wide analysis provides a detailed identification of Hsfs and Hsps in lettuce. Chromosomal location and syntenic region analysis together with our transcriptional analysis under different light conditions provide candidate genes for breeding programs aiming to produce lettuce varieties able to grow healthy under hydroponic systems that use artificial light.},

	abstract = {Consumer demand for novel, visually attractive ornamentals has often overshadowed the functional value plants may provide for flower-visiting insects. As native and nonnative species are hybridized for form, color, flowering, and disease resistance, it is important to assess whether some of these alterations influence plant nutrient quality for foraging insect pollinators. A study was conducted to ascertain the resource value of ornamental cultivars compared with their native congeners. The nectar volume and pollen quantity, viability, and protein content of 10 species of popular herbaceous flowering plants, commonly advertised as pollinator-friendly, were evaluated in northcentral Florida. Each genus encompassed a native and nonnative species, apart from pentas. Native species included blanket flower (Gaillardia pulchella), lanceleaf coreopsis (Coreopsis lanceolata), pineland lantana (Lantana depressa), and scarlet sage (Salvia coccinea). Nonnative species included Barbican™ yellow-red ring blanket flower (Gaillardia aristata ‘Gaiz005’), Bloomify™ rose lantana (Lantana camara ‘UF-1011-2’), mysty salvia (Salvia longispicata × farinacea ‘Balsalmysty’), Lucky Star® dark red pentas (Pentas lanceolata ‘PAS1231189’), ruby glow pentas (Pentas lanceolata ‘Ruby glow’) and UpTick™ Gold \& Bronze coreopsis (Coreopsis × ‘Baluptgonz’). Floral rewards differed significantly across species. The native scarlet sage exhibited the largest nectar volume per flower in the summer (2.13 ± 0.17 µL), followed by the nonnative mysty salvia (1.26 ± 0.17 µL). In the fall, ruby glow pentas exhibited the largest nectar volume per flower (1.09 ± 0.17 µL) compared with all other ornamentals. The composite flowers of the native and nonnative blanket flower and coreopsis species had the lowest nectar volume per flower regardless of sampling date. Likewise, ruby glow pentas displayed the highest quantity of pollen grains (96.29 ± 0.12) per sample, followed by Lucky star pentas (52.33 ± 0.12), and Barbican blanket flower (50.98 ± 0.12). Pollen viability was similarly high (92\% to 98\%) among all species, apart from Bloomify rose lantana (20\%) and pineland lantana (48\%). Pollen protein content was highest in Uptick coreopsis (11.378 ± 1.860 μg/mg dry weight) and Lucky star pentas (10.656 ± 3.726 μg/mg dry weight), followed by lanceleaf coreopsis (7.918 ± 1.793 μg/mg dry weight). These results largely showed that the nonnative ornamentals selected provided resource-rich floral rewards, comparable to native congeners. Still, care should be taken in making similar assessments of other modern floral types.},

	abstract = {RNA polymerase II is an essential multiprotein complex that transcribes thousands of genes, being a fundamental component of the transcription initiation complex. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II is formed by a 10-multisubunit conserved core complex, and two additional peripheral subunits, Rpb4 and Rpb7, form the Rpb4/7 subcomplex. Although transcription is vital for cell and organismal viability, little is known about the transcription initiation complex in sugarcane. An initial characterization of the sugarcane RNA polymerase subunit IV (ScRpb4) was performed. Our results demonstrate that ScRpb4 is evolutionarily conserved across kingdoms. At the molecular level, ScRpb4 expression was found in vegetative and reproductive tissues. Furthermore, the expression of ScRpb4 remained stable under various stress conditions, most likely to ensure a proper transcriptional response. Optimal conditions to express ScRpb4 in vitro for further studies were also identified. In this study, an initial characterization of the sugarcane polymerase II subunit IV is presented. Our results open the window to more specific experiments to study ScRpb4 function, for instance, crystal structure determination and pull-down assays as well as their function under biotic and abiotic stresses.},

	abstract = {Leaf angle shapes plant architecture, allowing for optimal light interception to maximize photosynthesis and yield, and therefore is a crucial agronomic trait. Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa L.) R2R3-type MYB transcription factor OsMYB7 determines leaf angle in a developmental stage-specific manner. OsMYB7-overexpressing lines produced wide-angled leaves and osmyb7 knockout mutants exhibited erect leaves. This phenotype was restricted to the lamina joints at the late developmental stage. In agreement with these observations, OsMYB7 was preferentially expressed in the lamina joints of post-mature leaves. Since OsMYB7 homologs are transcriptional repressors of lignin biosynthesis, we examined whether OsMYB7 might inhibit thickening of secondary cell walls. Although OsMYB7 repressed lignin biosynthesis, it enhanced thickening of sclerenchyma cell walls by elevating cellulose contents at the lamina joints. Furthermore, we found that OsMYB7 affects endogenous auxin levels in lamina joints, and the adaxial cells of lamina joints in OsMYB7-overexpressing lines and osmyb7 knockout mutants exhibited enhanced and reduced elongation, respectively, compared to the wild type. These results suggest that OsMYB7 promotes leaf inclination partially through decreasing free auxin levels and promoting cell elongation at the adaxial side of lamina joints.},

Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is a highly consumed vegetable crop susceptible heat stress. High temperatures limit lettuce’s overall yield, quality and marketability. Lettuce LIM genes have not been identified and their role in response to high temperatures is not known. Aiming to identify potential new targets for thermoresilience, we searched for LIM genes in lettuce and compared them with orthologous of several dicotyledons and monocotyledons plant species. We identified fourteen lettuce LIM genes distributed into eight different subgroups using a genome-wide analysis strategy. Three belonging to DAR (DA means “large” in Chinese) class I, two DAR class II, one in the WLIM1, two in the WLIM2, one in the PLIM1, two in the PLIM2 class, one ßLIM and two δLIMs. No DAR-like were identified in any of the species analyzed including lettuce. Interestingly, unlike other gene families in lettuce which underwent large genome tandem duplications, LIM genes did not increase in number compared to other plant species. The response to heat stress induced a dynamic transcriptional response on LsLIM genes. All heat stress regimes, including night stress, day stress and day and night stress were largely responsible for changes in LIM transcriptional expression. Our global analysis at the genome level provides a detailed identification of LIM genes in lettuce and other dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species. Gene structure, physical and chemical properties as well as chromosomal location and Cis-regulatory element analysis together with our gene expression analysis under different temperature regimes identified LsWLIM1, LsWLIM2b, LsDAR3 and LsDAR5 as candidate genes that could be used by breeding programs aiming to produce lettuce varieties able to withstand high temperatures.},

	abstract = {The plant hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating important functions in strawberry fruit development. Although a few studies have described the complex auxin biosynthetic and signaling pathway in wild diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca), the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin biosynthesis and crosstalk in octoploid strawberry fruit development are not fully characterized. To address this knowledge gap, comprehensive transcriptomic analyses were conducted at different stages of fruit development and compared between the achene and receptacle to identify developmentally regulated auxin biosynthetic genes and transcription factors during the fruit ripening process. Similar to wild diploid strawberry, octoploid strawberry accumulates high levels of auxin in achene compared to receptacle. Genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and conjugation, such as Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis (TAAs), YUCCA (YUCs), and Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3s), were found to be primarily expressed in the achene, with low expression in the receptacle. Interestingly, several genes involved in auxin transport and signaling like Pin-Formed (PINs), Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid Proteins (Aux/IAAs), Transport Inhibitor Response 1 / Auxin-Signaling F-Box (TIR/AFBs) and Auxin Response Factor (ARFs) were more abundantly expressed in the receptacle. Moreover, by examining DEGs and their transcriptional profiles across all six developmental stages, we identified key auxin-related genes co-clustered with transcription factors from the NAM-ATAF1,2-CUC2/ WRKYGQK motif (NAC/WYKY), Heat Shock Transcription Factor and Heat Shock Proteins (HSF/HSP), APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) and MYB transcription factor groups. These results elucidate the complex regulatory network of auxin biosynthesis and its intricate crosstalk within the achene and receptacle, enriching our understanding of fruit development in octoploid strawberries.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation is crucial for regulating gene expression and silencing transposons. While the spatiotemporal specificity of DNA methylation controls organ formation and development, the molecular mechanisms underlying locus- or tissue-specific DNA methylation remain unclear. Previously, locus- or tissue-specific DNA methylation was thought to depend solely on the recognition of histone methylations. Here we show that high expression of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24-nt siRNAs) leads to incremental CHH methylation at specific loci via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway during female gametophyte development in rice. We also identify a DNA motif, the Female-specific RdDM-associated Element (FRE), which guides methylation to these loci. Furthermore, we show that the female-preferentially expressed protein OsCLSY3 directly interacts with FRE to regulate CHH methylation specifically in female reproductive tissues. These findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism necessary for tissue- and locus-specific de novo DNA methylation that might be conserved across diverse organisms including animals.},

Using representative members of green algae, bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, we expanded the evolutionary history of NAC transcription factors to unveil the relationships among members of this gene family. We found a massive increase in the number of NAC transcription factors from green algae to lycophytes and an even larger increase in flowering plants. Many of the NAC clades arose later during evolution since we found eudicot- and monocot-specific clades. Cis-elements analysis in NAC promoters showed the presence of abiotic and biotic stress as well as hormonal response elements, which indicate the ancestral function of NAC transcription factor genes in response to environmental stimuli and in plant development. At the transcriptional level, the expression of NAC transcription factors was low or absent in male reproduction, particularly mature pollen, across the plant kingdom. We also identified NAC genes with conserved expression patterns in response to heat stress in Marchantia polymorpha and Oryza sativa. Our study provides further evidence that transcriptional mechanisms associated with stress responses and development emerged early during plant land adaptation and are still conserved in flowering plants and domesticated crops.},
